Some other projects I do on GitHub (english).

## [Verilog VGA](https://electronicayciencia.github.io/verilog-vga/)

A project to learn how to work with a Gowin FPGA (Sipeed Tang Nano) and a LCD display.

Increasing degree of difficulty:
- Patterns
- Images
- Text
- Serial terminal

Each repository have a readme file listing key points and examples, as well as an extensive blog post with a detailed explanation (in spanish).

## [wPi_soft_lcd](https://electronicayciencia.github.io/wPi_soft_lcd/)

Big-banged I2C LCD for Raspberry PI

Library to use PCF8574 based LCD via software I2C bus in a Raspberry Pi. This is a C library that you can use to connect a PCF8574 based LCD to any of your available GPIO ports. It uses software emulated (bit-banged) I2C bus.

(Updated Jul 2018)

## [wPi_soft_i2c](https://electronicayciencia.github.io/wPi_soft_i2c/)

Software emulated I2C for Raspberry using wiringPi.
This is a basic software (bit-banged) implementation of the I2C protocol using WiringPi library for GPIO.

## [Digest::ssdeep](https://metacpan.org/pod/Digest::ssdeep)

Pure Perl ssdeep (CTPH) fuzzy hashing

This module provides simple implementation of ssdeep fuzzy hashing also known as Context Triggered Piecewise Hashing (CTPH).

Thanks to Christoph Biedl for create a Debian Package from it: [libdigest-ssdeep-perl](https://packages.debian.org/buster/libdigest-ssdeep-perl).
